Ammonia and carbon dioxide are the most widely used natural refrigerants due to their excellent thermodynamic properties. On the other hand, fluorocarbon-based refrigerants are synthetic substances, which began to be developed and produced in the 1930s. Many types of Gases are available in the Market - The most widely used zeotropic mixtures today are the following: R-R134, 404A, R-410A, R-407A, In all of them, the slip produced by the different boiling and condensation points of the substances that make up each mixture is taken into account. Applications: Refrigeration and Air Condtioning","brand":""}},"__N_SSG":true}
