Sheet is a metal sheet coated with protective metallic and organic coatings that prevents rust. This is commonly used in automotive, wind, and solar industries. Standard Size is Roll or pcs 4x8ft and available in many thickness .  Aluminium is currently extracted exclusively from raw bauxite, an ore found in heavy clay-like soil types several metres below the surface of the ground. This ore is then refined in a hot lime and caustic soda solution, producing alumina, a white oxide powder. Standard Size is Roll or pcs 4x8ft and available in many thickness ."}},"__N_SSG":true}
