They are often found in electrical distribution and industrial applications, where machinery must have its source of driving power removed for adjustment or repair. Disconnectors can be operated manually or by a motor, and may be paired with an earthing switch to ground the portion that has been isolated from the system for ensuring the safety of equipment and the personnel working on it.","brand":"SCAME/ABB/HAGER/SELEX"}},"__N_SSG":true}
